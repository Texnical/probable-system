# probable-system
Automated distribution of resume over LaTeX, Docker, GitHub, and GitHub
Actions.

The world we live in today is surrounded by automation. Everything is
sped up and designed to make our lives easier, more clean, more precise.
For an engineer or developer, the ability to take advantage of this
automation is paramount, and to be able to not only thrive in such an
environment, but to build on it and further that world is what will
shape our future. It's with this mentality that this project exists:
to take advantage of modern technologies and produce a clean,
professional product by means of automation through VCS and CI.

To view the latest deployment build of my resume through this system,
